    INSTALLATION

On Unix-like systems, with Make and a C compiler, run `make' then
`make install'; to uninstall, run `make uninstall'.

It should be necessary to run `make install' as root (DESTDIR is supported).

The following files are installed to the following default locations:

xorg-choose-window -> /usr/local/bin/xorg-choose-window

    DEPENDENCIES

XCB, xcb-util-keysyms, xcb-util-wm: http://xcb.freedesktop.org/

    USAGE

Running the executable draws a string of characters over each visible window.
Typing one of those strings causes the program to print the corresponding window
ID to standard output and exit.  If any non-matching keys are pressed, the
program exits without printing anything.

Run `xorg-choose-window CHARACTERS', where CHARACTERS defines those available
for use in the displayed strings; eg. `xorg-choose-window asdfjkl' is a good
choice for a QWERTY keyboard layout.

If an error is encountered, the program exits with status 1.
